# Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using React and is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the React components and application logic.
  - `components/`: Reusable UI components.
  - `pages/`: Specific page components for routing.
  - `assets/`: Static assets like images.
- `public/`: Contains static files like `index.html` and `favicon.ico`.
